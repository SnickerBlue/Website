            <p>
                You know they call it America’s pastime, but when you sit and think about it, this game goes by at a damn snail’s pace.
                I mean it’s just hours of nothing interrupted by the occasional crack. Repeat that one hundred and thirty-one more times and you’ve got one whole single-A season.
                It’s really not that interesting. The watching part at least.
                <br /><br />
                When <i>was</i> the last time I went to a game in my free time? <i>“NEXT UP TO BAT, PLUTO WELLES”</i> My train of thought ends there I guess.
                They aren’t cheering as much as they were for the last guy are they?
                <br /><br />
                <i>“I’m a little bit of a monster. Drowning in what you thought dried up yesterday.”</i> Is it weird that I chose a Vylet Pony song for my walkout music?
                Is that why they aren’t cheering as much? Wait I should probably do that moving the bat in front of me thing while I’m walking up,
                make them think I’m prepping myself for the at-bat.
                <br /><br />
                Okay, in the batter’s box, wide stance, bat on shoulder, wiggle the wrists a bit, breathe out. He’s gonna throw a fastball right? It’s the first pitch,
                he has to throw a fastball. Just make contact. Contact, contact, conta… <i>SWING</i> “STRIKE ONE!”
                <br /><br />
                Yup he threw a fastball. Maybe this time he’ll go with a changeup to throw me off. Wait no, it’s too soon for a changeup, so he’ll probably just throw another fastball.
                What am I talking about? He knows that I know it’s gonna be a fastball. He’s throwing an outside breaking ball. Just hold. Hold, hold, hooolll… “BALL ONE!”
                <br /><br />
                Alright, we’re in this, this is light work. What now? Maybe he’s gonna throw me another breaking ball to keep me on my feet. What if it’s a screwball?
                Does this guy even throw a screwball? I mean he probably doesn’t but I… I should call a timeout. “Timeout.” “TIMEOUT.” Okay, he’s not gonna throw a screwball.
                It’s probably just another fastball. Just swing and make contact Pluto. Contact, con… <i>SWING CRACK</i> “FOUL BALL, STRIKE TWO!”
                <br /><br />
                At least I made contact, that’s a start. Maybe I scared him a little, threw him off his game. Ah who am I kidding, he doesn’t care.
                What’s he going with this time? Maybe just another fastball. No, I made contact with the last one, he’ll probably throw a changeup to throw off my timing.
                Just swing a bit later, and make contact Pluto. Contact, contact, contact… <i>SWING CRACK</i>
                <br /><br />
                OKAY THAT’S IN PLAY. DROP YOUR BAT AND RUN TO FIRST PLUTO. RUN. RUN. RUN. RU… “OUT!”
